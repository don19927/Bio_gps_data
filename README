I haven't figured out how to create a loop to upload this data yet but for now I'm uploading in groups into the mysql table.  This code includes all of the cur.executes I performed but only one will be performed at a time.  If you run this code only the table will be created but if you only run the cur.execute(INSERT INTO ....) then data will be uploaded into the table.
